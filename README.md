The API Fresco is a creative workshop concept which aims to build and test the API awareness. Targeting technical and non-technical profiles, it can help erasing fake-beliefs around APIs. The API Fresco explains some concepts and also show the links between these concepts.

This workshop is collaborative, empirical & entertaining.

**Ideal number of attendees: 4 to 8**  
**Format: on site or remotely with a digital workplace (Mural, Miro, Draft.io, etc.)**

## Prerequisites
- [x] An API expert, to facilitate the workshop,
- [x] A set of cards provided in this repository,
- [x] A digital workplace set up, if you want to do it remotely. Templates are provided in this repository.

## Development of the workshop
This workshop takes place in three main phases: the introduction, the freco build and the conclusion.

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Explain the workshop  
The Introduction's aim is for the attendees to understand how does the API Fresco plays out. 
Explain:
- [x] how will the game play out,
- [x] how the participants will interact, what they will have to do.

You will find these information in the [section 2 - "Fresco build"](https://github.com/michelin/API-Fresco#2-fresco-build).

#### 1.2. Show them an example
For this example, you, as a facilitator, will do what the participants will have to do in the next phases.  

The "API" concept is the perfect one to begin with. Say to the attendees that this concept is assigned to you.  
You then explain the concept of APIs to the others and place it at the center of the fresco.  
Eventually, you explain that you don't draw links with other concepts as this is the first one, but for the next concept they will have to do so.

#### 1.3. Let them try the digital workplace (*Only for remote workshops*)
If the workshop is done remotely, the aim of this introduction phase is also for the participants to appropriate how to use the digital workplace.

- [x] Send them the link of the digital workplace
- [x] Explain them how to move on the fresco, and let them try
- [X] Explain them how to move an object on the fresco, and let them try

This step could seem optional but the experience shows that it is very valuable and really time-saving for the rest of the workshop.

### 2. Fresco build
The API Fresco build plays out in different waves.  
 
Each wave is the opportunity to discover 8 concepts and understand them.  
Each wave also complement the fresco by making the links between these concepts and the one already here on the fresco.

**Wave conduct**
1. *Reveal the concepts*  
    The 8 concepts of each waves are hidden to the attendees. The first step of the wave is to reveal the concepts to the participants, by spreading the cards on the table or unlocking the cover image (if done remotely).
    
2. *Assign the concepts to the participants*
