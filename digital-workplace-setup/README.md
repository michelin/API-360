## Example link
You can [find here](https://app.mural.co/t/teamsandbox1918/m/teamsandbox1918/1591213119387/d715eaa6d4e0cb84cfa581a693afa2bc4381afe7) a setup example of API Fresco in a digital workplace.  

**Example's wave 1**  
In this example, you can see that the first wave is already done (the hiding element has been put aside on the top of the screen), and 9 cards are already put on the freco. These 9 cards are the example one (the API card) + the 8 cards of the first wave.  

**Example's wave 2**  
As you can see, the hiding element has been removed for the wave 2 too, on the top of the screen. Nevertheless, we can see that the wave 2 has just started because the 8 cards are still on the top of the screen; we are actually at the cards assignment step.  

**Example's wave 3**  
The wave 3 has not begun yet, the hiding element is properly hiding the 8 cards of this third wave.
