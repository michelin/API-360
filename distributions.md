## What is a distribution?
A distribution is an API 360° game mode. It is always targeting a population and a theme. Actually, the distribution corresponds to the story you want to tell to your attendance. Do you want to tell them how to securize an API? Or how an API could be monetized? 

The number of possible distributions is unlimited. Hence the best distributions in you context/company are probably the ones you'll define by yourselves. Nevertheless, you'll find in this page a few examples of distributions that we propose.

## Examples 

### "API Education" Distribution targeting management/business people, beginners level

As this level is easy, the board remains empty at the beginning of the game.  
The cards should be read and placed on the board as follows:

**Wave 1**:
1. API
2. API Producer
3. API Manager
4. API Portal
5. API Owner
6. API Consumer
7. Application

**Wave 2**:
1. Reuse
2. End User
3. API Key
4. Policies
5. API Analytics
6. API Monetization
7. Authentication 

### "API Security" Distribution targeting tech/architect people, intermediate level

As this level is medium, that implies that the attendance already knows API basics. Hence, you can start the workshop with the following cards and related links already drawn on the board:

1. API
2. API Backend
3. API Host
4. API Producer
5. API Manager
6. API Proxy
7. Application
8. API Consumer

The beginners level would have one more wave at the beginning, corresponding to these cards.

Then, the cards should be read and placed on the board as follow:

**Wave 1**:
1. Description File
2. Environments
3. API Security
4. Authentication
5. Inbound Authentication
6. Outbound Authentication

**Wave 2**:
1. Identification
2. API Key
3. Authorization
4. Basic Auth
5. OAuth2
6. JWT

**Wave 3**:
1. Policies

3. API Analytics
4. Throttling
5. Data Masking
6. Mutual TLS

### "API Monetization" Distribution targeting management/business people, beginners level
