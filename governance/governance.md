## 1. Community

If you’d like to speak to maintainers of this project, you can reach us through a bunch of different channels.

- On github, you can always notify the entire project team by using the @github/API-360 handle.
- On github again, you can contribute creating [issues](https://github.com/michelin/API-360/issues) to suggest a fix or an improvement.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Users** are community members who have a need in terms of API education. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements. We asks users to participate in community and give us as much feedback as they can. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users.
- **Contributors** are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. It could be anyone who identify requirements, report issue, add value to the project with a merged pull request, evangelizing or helping the community to grow.  
    See [Contributor guide]() for more details.
- **Maintainers** are people responsible over the direction of the project and are committed to improving it in the long run. There are the only people in a project with commit access.

## 3. Decision-Making process

The default decision making mechanism for the API 360° project is [lazy consensus](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#decision-making). This means that any decision on issues is considered supported by the core team as long as nobody objects.

Silence on any consensus decision is implicit agreement and equivalent to explicit agreement. Explicit agreement may be stated at will.

If any team member raises objections, the team members work together towards a solution that all involved can accept. This solution is again subject to lazy consensus.

### 3.1. Commit Policy

To approve change proposals from contributors, API 360° project applies the Review-Then-Commit policy which requires that all pull-request changes receive lazy consensus approval by maintainers, meaning at least one binding +1 vote and no vetos (-1) in order to be committed.

### 3.2. Mainainer member status

Maintainer member status may be given to those who have made major ongoing contributions to the API 360° project for at least 3 months. This is usually in the form of assets improvements and/or notable work on documentation, but organizing events or community support could also be taken into account.

New members may be proposed by any existing maitainers. It is highly desirable to reach consensus about acceptance of a new member. However, the proposal is ultimately voted on by a formal majority vote (requires more binding +1 votes than binding -1 votes) during a Governance Committee.
